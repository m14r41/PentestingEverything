# DevSecOps Overview

## What is DevSecOps?

DevSecOps is an extension of the DevOps methodology that integrates security practices into the DevOps process. The goal of DevSecOps is to ensure that security is a fundamental aspect of the development lifecycle, from design through deployment and maintenance. This approach emphasizes the need to incorporate security measures throughout the development process, rather than treating security as a separate or final step.

## Most Common Terms

- **DevOps**: A practice that combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops) to enhance collaboration and productivity by automating infrastructure, workflows, and continuously measuring application performance.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: A practice where code changes are automatically tested and merged into a shared repository frequently.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: The practice of automating the release of applications to production environments, ensuring that code changes can be released reliably and quickly.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable scripts rather than manual processes.
- **Security as Code**: Integrating security practices directly into the CI/CD pipeline and development processes.
- **Vulnerability Management**: The process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating security vulnerabilities within software and systems.
